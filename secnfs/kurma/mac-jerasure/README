Enable Jerasure in Mac OSX.

1. Checkout Hybris repo: git clone https://github.com/pviotti/hybris.git

2. Replace the three Makefiles under hybris/jerasure with the ones here, then make

3. Then, copy the libJerasure.dylib and libJerasure.jni.jnilib under hybris/lib
to /usr/local/lib

4. Finally, add /usr/local/lib to java.path.library.  To do that in Eclipse:

Specifically: select Project, right click -> Properties / Java Build Path /
Libraries tab, select the Jerasure.jar, expand it, select Native library
location, click Edit, folder chooser dialog will appear)

Now. JerasureTest should pass.
