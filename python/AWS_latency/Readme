Replicating data on AWS S3
==========================

AWS buckets are region bound
Each region is comprised of multiple AZs (Availability zones)
Each AZ is a data center and AZs in the same region can see each other straight away

If you make a bucket without specifying region, it gets created in US-standard region
If you make a bucket with region specified, then in order to access it, you must connect to the same region
If you are in the same region, the latency will be lower -> Cross region replication

Cross region replication:
-------------------------
This is possible but it must be set up before hand
Versioning must be enabled on the buckets
You have to create a role that AWS can assume and use to replicate data
Data is replicated between "source" and "destination" buckets
Each region should have one bucket
One source bucket can replicate to one destination bucket, not multiple
