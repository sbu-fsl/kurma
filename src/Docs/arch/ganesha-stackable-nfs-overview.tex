\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{G}{anesha} NFS being a userland implementation of Network File
System protocol is a convenient place to try out new features and algorithms.
Duo Yi and Youlong Cheng implemented security features in proxy server
\cite{NFSv4SecurityProxy} using Ganesha NFS. The implementation is mostly in
NFSv4 protocol, which makes it highly inflexible and non-modular. Stackable
FSAL might help implement features in a cleaner way.

Stackable FSAL was explored by implementing a basic file-encrypting
stackable file system in NFS Ganesha version 2.0.

\section{Background}
The NFSv4 Security Proxy project involved security features - antivirus, logging,
and filtering based on policy. Implementation was done at development stages of
NFS Ganesha version 2.0. To match the latest version of NFS Ganesha, the security proxy project
had to be ported.

Implementation was done in NFSv4 protocol layer introduced difficulty in porting --
changes in NFSv4 operations rename, open, and close had modifications in the way
access mode was checked. TODO: What exactly is change.

Implementing in NFSv4 layer also makes it inflexible. Irrespective of whether FSAL\_PROXY
is used, these features are present. Using stackable FSAL module is a solution.

\section{Project Design}
In order to design stackable file system, an overview of NFS
Ganesha architecture is discussed first.

\subsection{FSAL - File System Abstraction Layer}
There are several types of file systems supported by Ganesha. The FSAL is an
abstraction layer that abstracts each file system to a set of common operations
that are handled by each module.

Each module can be configured using special key-value pairs in
configuration file that is parsed by NFS Ganesha. For instance, FSAL\_PROXY
required Srv\_Addr to be defined in configuration file.

  \label{fsalProxyArch}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{PROXY FSAL}
This is an abstraction that implements proxy machine between a client and a
server. FSAL\_PROXY uses NFSv4. Figure \ref{fsalProxyArch} shows how requests
from clients are handled by FSAL\_PROXY by contacting server.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Init module invokes config parser %1
\item `proxy.ganesha.conf' is parsed %2
\item Library mentioned as value of `FSAL\_Shared\_Library' is loaded %3
\item dlopen() invokes constructor that registers FSAL of library %4
\item FSAL added to fsal\_list, call backs registered for configuration (init\_config) and creating export (create\_export) %5
\item EXPORT block in config file corresponds to a line in /etc/exports in Linux. Export entry is created with the FSAL
mentioned in EXPORT block. In this case PROXY. %6
\item Proxy operations are registered with the export entry (function pointers for read, write, open, close, etc.) %7
\item After config file is parsed, all FSALs in fsal\_list are initialized %8
\item Initialization of FSAL Proxy %9
\item Configuration items specific to FSAL Proxy, such as server address (Srv\_addr) is obtained from config parse tree %10
\item Thread spawned to connect to server and initialize RPC %11
\item RPC socket that's used for send RPC request and listen %12
\item Worker threads spawned for handling requests from client %13
\item NFSv4 request from client received by worker thread %14
\item After access permission (supports even authentication) checks of client on export entry corresponding to request, NFSv4 service function (usually nfs4\_Compound) is called %15
\item All metadata is maintained in cache inode and dentry data structures in AVL trees. Request received from NFSv4 operations. %16
\item Request is forwarded to FSAL operations registered to particular export entry %17
\item Server request through RPC socket %18
\item NFSv4 request to Server %19
\item NFSv4 response from Server %20
\item Response passed to PROXY handler %21
\item Response passed to cache inode %22
\item Response passed to NFSv4 protocol handler %23
\item Response passed to worker thread %24
\item svc\_sendreply() to client %25
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stackable FSAL}
Every EXPORT block in config file has a FS\_Specific entry that is passed to create\_export()
function of FSAL of the export entry. The FS\_Specific entry is again an FSAL name. This
opens possibilities for using the FS\_Specific for stacking on top of a particular FSAL.
Figure \ref{fsalStackArch} shows architecture and working of a  general stackable FSAL.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Config file parsed %1
\item EXPORT block corresponds to Stackable FSAL. Stackable FSAL's create\_export() is called with a parameter FS\_Specific. %2
\item FS\_Specific is another FSAL module. It's create\_export() method is called. %3
\item Handlers of FS\_Specific FSAL is returned %4
\item Stackable FSAL handlers are registered for the export entry %5
\item When a client request comes, Stackable FSAL handler is called %6
\item After performing its own operation, FS\_Specific FSAL's handler is called %7
\item Response from FS\_Specific FSAL handler %8
\item Response passed back to client %9
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CRYPTFS Stackable file system}
CRYPTFS is a stackable FSAL module that secures data using cryptography. CRYPTFS when used in a proxy machine
encrypts data that is written to server and decrypts data when read from server. Architecture of CRYPTFS in proxy
is as shown in figure \ref{fsalCryptArch}.

Control flow is similar to a general stackable FSAL. All operations are merely wrappers that call underlying PROXY FSAL
except read and write. Write involved DES encryption in counter mode (see figure \ref{fsalCryptEncrypt}) and read involves
decryption (see figure \ref{fsalCryptDecrypt}).

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item To use stackable FSAL for a NFSv4 Security features can be implemented by using a File Handle to
File Name Map in stackable FSAL. After digging cache inode data structures, I think they are right
that file name cannot be retrieved from file handle. Needs to be seen if there are other ways of
doing this (possibly using cache inode data structures).
\item The existing restriction on FSAL Stackable to have only one underlying file system can be
worked around by compromising on flexibility (yet to be checked). Also, I think it's worth
exploring a change in config parsing to allow multiple layers. Further investigation needs to be
done on this.
\item Implementation of CRYPTFS has some performance improvements that I have identified. Also,
impact on performance by inclusion of CRYPTFS stackable file system is yet to be
measured.
\item Performance of NFS Ganesha Proxy with different ports of communication with server and client machines
is also worth study.
\end{itemize}
