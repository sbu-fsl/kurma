Contributing and Using Git  -   Paul Sheer <paulsheer@gmail.com>   -   18 October 2012



If you would like to contribute to nfs-ganesha development:


There is a process to dumping the source (using git), modifying the
source, and pushing your changes back. This process is quite simple and
requires only a few commands. These are as follows:

Establish from the other developers which branch of whose repository is
the best to work in. Create an account on github.com, login and view
that developers repository. Click "Fork" on the top right to create a
copy of that repository. Let's say your name is "Paul Sheer" (replace
"paul", "p_sheer" and "paulsheer" with your own name below), and say the
the developer who owns the repository is named Code Leader and his
github.com login is "codeleader". Now let's say the code branch is
"new-unstable-dev-project".

First you need to fetch the code you wish to work on:

    git clone git://github.com/codeleader/nfs-ganesha.git --branch new-unstable-dev-project
    cd nfs-ganesha

Now check what you have:

    git status

Now visit README.building for instructions on building and running.

Now fetch the latest updates:

    git remote update

Now do your development work.

When you are developing, testing etc.:

    git commit -a

There may be updates from other developers. Update to their new branch
"more-stable-dev-project" to include other work other people may have
done:

    git rebase origin/more-stable-dev-project

Then push your work up as follows:

    ssh-keygen
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the output into your ssh keys in your github.com account.

Then,

    git remote add paul_github git@github.com:paulsheer/nfs-ganesha.git
    git push paul_github new-unstable-dev-project:more-stable-dev-project
