This directory contains some example config files for various FSALs. It also
contains a few files to help document config options.

config.txt  - this file documents all the config options
logging.txt - this file documents the LOG config in more detail
export.txt  - this file documents the export config in more detail

The sample FSAL files:

ceph.conf
gpfs.conf
lustre.conf
pt.conf
vfs.conf
xfs.conf
zfs.conf

The most readily used FSAL for experimentation with Ganesha given a recent
kernel is FSAL_VFS using vfs.conf.
