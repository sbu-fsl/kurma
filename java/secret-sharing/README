This is the code of secret sharing library, which include algorithms such as
AONS-RS and CAONS-RS.  The code is from CDStore, which was in C++.  I added JNI
wrapper for kurma to use the algorithms in JAVA.

INSTALL on Linux
================
Install the dependency:

        $ sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0 libboost-all-dev libsnappy-dev libssl-dev

        $ git clone https://github.com/chintran27/CDStore.git
        $ cd CDStore/trunk/src/client/lib/gf_complete
        $ ./configure && make
        $ sudo make install

Then build in this directory.

        $ make          # on Linux


INSTALL on Mac
==============

        $ brew install openssl
        $ make -f Makefile.mac  # on mac


TEST
====
Test the C++ code:

        $ ./aontrs-test

Verify that it prints "SUCCEED!!!"


Test the java code:

        $ java secretsharing.CDCodecJNI

Verify that it prints "true".
